Cool?",active:a},{title:"What’s an NFT?",content:"NFT=Non-Fungible Token…not sure that helped…hmmm…money is fungible – if I give you a dollar bill it doesn’t matter which one I give you – they are all the same. Commodities like gold or corn are also fungible. Stuff – such as books, art, collectibles - tends to be of varying value and therefore not replaceable. We use NFTs all the time when we barter. In the digital world that was not possible because digital “stuff” could be replicated…but then…then came blockchain and opened up a whole new DeFi world of opportunities. The immutable blockchain record allows us to link between a digital asset and its owner and establish its uniqueness. In Snook achievements are unique and represent skill – which is what we record on the blockchain and is the source of value behind your NFT.",active:a},{title:"Will Snook work on IOS?",content:"Sure…one day...for now it's designed for desktop and not as a native app…so who cares?",active:a},{title:"What’s am I risking?",content:"Snook is a “kill or be killed” kind of game.
